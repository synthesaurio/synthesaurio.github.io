      <description>Hi I am Pablo Gomez, born in Guanajuato, Mexico. Research epidemiologist by day, audiovisual artist by night; I have been working in health sciences for the last 10 year. Trough my journey I have been fortunate to see the world from many perspectives. From working in farms in the southern border of Mexico, to working surrounded by computers in the basement of a research institution. I am interested in the intersection of science and art and how we can use technology to unravel the beauty of complex systems.</description>

      <description>I like exploring different music generes, sometimes I make ambient, sometimes a mix of nu-cumbia/house. I am currently working in my next album that will be a compilation of nu-cumbia/house tracks.
FOMO Los Pajaros My most recent release is inspired by the chicha peruana and birds of Latin America. I had some fun synthesizing bird sounds using frequency modulation synthesis. The song was composed and produced using the M8 tracker and mastered externally.</description>

      <description>See Synthesaurio Part of Synthesaurio is the generation of audio reactive generative visuals. I use glsl and other tools to prepare my visuals and tweak them live during my performances. I get my inspired from complex systems thinking and the emergence of macro patterns from individual behaviors.
