# Music

My music is heavily resonate deeply with my nostalgia borne from my distance from my homeland; trying to both preserve my identity while evolving incorporating new experiences. Drawing from diverse influences, I fuse rhythms of Latin rhythms from reggaeton and cumbia with ambient drones, soundscapes, and electronic genres like techno and house. Here is a brief demo of one of the tracks I have been working recently:
