# Music

Other people has described my music as: ambient, techno, cumbia, vaporwave, house; but I like to describe my music as **experimental cumbia**. My music is an expression of my nostalgia borne from my distance from my homeland, as well as a voice telling the stories of the world around me; trying to both preserve my Mexican identity while evolving incorporating new experiences as a migrant. Drawing from diverse influences, I fuse Latin rhythms from reggaeton and cumbia with ambient drones, soundscapes, and electronic genres like techno and house. Here is my most recent release **Cúmbias Esotéricas de Aztlán Vol. 1**:

# Visuals

Part of my artistic practice is to experiment with visuals. I have experience performing visuals along with my music, as well as doing visuals for other artists.
