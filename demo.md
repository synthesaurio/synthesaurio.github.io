# Music

Other people has described my music as: ambient, techno, cumbia, vaporwave, house; but I like to describe my music as **experimental cumbia**. My music is an expression of my nostalgia borne from my distance from my homeland, as well as a voice telling the stories of the world around me; trying to both preserve my Mexican identity while evolving incorporating new experiences as a migrant. Drawing from diverse influences, I fuse Latin rhythms from reggaeton and cumbia with ambient drones, soundscapes, and electronic genres like techno and house. Here is a brief demo of one of the tracks I have been working recently:

More of my music can be found in my other music platform profiles. I am currently working in my first album that compiles songs I have been writing about resistance, [degrowth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degrowth#:~:text=The%20idea%20of%20degrowth%20is,increase%20of%20human%20living%20standards.) and justice.

# Performance

I have been lucky to perform in different countries and scenes, including Mexico, Ecuador, and the United states. Some of my previous performances include:

# Visuals

Part of my artistic practice is to experiment with visuals. I have experience performing visuals along with my music, as well as doing visuals for other artists.
Here is a short reel of some visuals I have performed previously
