<p>Hi I am Pablo Gomez, born in Guanajuato, Mexico. Research epidemiologist by day, audiovisual artist by night; I have been working in health sciences for the last 10 year. Trough my journey I have been fortunate to see the world from many perspectives. From working in farms in the southern border of Mexico, to working surrounded by computers in the basement of a research institution. I am interested in the intersection of science and art and how we can use technology to unravel the beauty of complex systems.<br>
In my &ldquo;daytime&rdquo; job I use techniques in statistics, programming and simulation modeling; in my artistic work I like to explore techniques such as algorithmic composition for both music and visuals. I find my inspiration in the interrelationship of human society with nature, and I like to think that my work serves as bridges between different areas of knowledge.<br>
I am an advocate of open access frameworks and affordable computing, and I am interested in liberating from the capitalist thinking that you need expensive tools to make good digital art.</p>
<p>You can find my music on all streaming platforms including: Bandcamp, Spotify, YouTube and Apple Music.</p>

                                    <p>I like exploring different music generes, sometimes I make ambient, sometimes a mix of nu-cumbia/house. I am currently working in my next album that will be a compilation of nu-cumbia/house tracks.</p>
<h2 id="fomo-los-pajaros">FOMO Los Pajaros</h2>
<p>My most recent release is inspired by the chicha peruana and birds of Latin America. I had some fun synthesizing bird sounds using frequency modulation synthesis. The song was composed and produced using the <a href="https://dirtywave.com">M8 tracker</a> and mastered externally. You can listen to it on soundcloud and <a href="https://synthesaurio.bandcamp.com/track/fomo-los-pajaros">Bandcamp</a></p>

<p>Part of Synthesaurio is the generation of audio reactive generative visuals. I use glsl and other tools to prepare my visuals and tweak them live during my performances. I get my inspired from complex systems thinking and the emergence of macro patterns from individual behaviors.</p>
