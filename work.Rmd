# Illustration/Prints

## Print Making

My work in print making covers similar topics as in my music. Previous work has been used in promotional materials for events, and clothes such as bandanna and shirts.

This is a design I did for an event, the money from the bandanna sales was donated to some local mutual aid organizations. Medium screen printing on fabric.
